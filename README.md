When taking a Quiz in Canvas that has multiple attempts. It can become tiresome to re-enter all your answers just to update the one question that you got wrong. 

Clicking on the bookmark before submitting the quiz will save all the answers you have entered. Then after opening the quiz again, click the bookmark again to load the answers that you saved.

When loading it will only fill the questions that have not been touched (to avoid overwriting new answers).
